First of all, launch ProxyDNSVM. 
In this case we assume that its IP address is 172.17.255.254.

Now, assure that your VMs use ProxyDNSVM as default gateway and DNS machine.

To do that, prepend to the /etc/resolv.conf file the following entry
nameserver 172.17.255.254

To change the default gateway, execute the following commands:
route del default
route add default gw 172.17.255.254 eth1
